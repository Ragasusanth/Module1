# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is *even* or *odd* using if...else statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
3. Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
   - If true, print "EVEN".
   - Else, print "ODD".
4. End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program


number = int(input())
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")


## Output

## Result

Thus the program has been successfully executed



# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
2. Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
3. Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
4. Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
5. Print the value of a with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of b with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of c with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of d with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program

a = (1 == True)
b = (1 == False)
c = True + 3
d = False + 7
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")
print(f"c: {c}")
print(f"d: {d}")

## Output

## Result

Thus the program has been successfully executed




# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'S' and 'K' using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character 'S'.
2. Print the character 'K'.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

ch1 = 'S'
ch2 = 'k'
print(ch1)
print(ch2)


## Output

## Result

Thus the program has been successfully executed




# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable num1 (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable num2 (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number x using the complex(num1, num2) function.
4. Print the complex number x.
5. Print the real part of x using x.real.
6. Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

## ðŸ’» Program

num1=int(input())
num2=int(input())
x=complex(num1,num2)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)

## Output

# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
2. Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program


men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()  
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

## Output
